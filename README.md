This project builds a foundation in Semantic HTML with a focus on accessibility, SEO, and ARIA roles. Through step-by-step tasks, learners will structure web pages that are both visually clear and accessible. By the end, theyâ€™ll understand the value of semantic elements and inclusive design in modern web development.
